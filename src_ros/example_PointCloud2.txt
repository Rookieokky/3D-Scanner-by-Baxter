Using the following point cloud format,
  pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr cloud_pcl_ptrï¼›
  sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 cloud_ros;
  pcl::toROSMsg(*cloud_pcl_ptr, cloud_ros);
The cloud_ros has the following content, viewed by "rostopic echo".
We can see that it's using: 1) 32 byte length, 2) "rgb" at 16th byte, 3) "rgb" datatype 7, which is float.
Despite this, we can set things like this: 1) 16 byte length, 2) "rgb" at 12th byte, 3) "rgb" datatype 6, which is uint
